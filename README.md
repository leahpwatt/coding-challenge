A Punk Band Referral App for Tim Berners-Lee to Grow the World Wide Web! 

This code example is a front-end CRUD app that provides a way for contributors to view and add referral links. Each item is linked to its own page. Contributors can also edit the titles of existing links or delete them. I hardcoded some data for users to see examples of what to contribute.

The app is built in React and uses a combination of semantic-ui-react and material-ui libraries; I selected these because they are user friendly and aesthetically pleasing in their simplicity. I also pulled SASS into the project instead of using raw CSS. For the purpose of this exercise, I utilized local storage to show the click increments between pages; however, if I were to do it over again, I would employ Redux for state management. 

Here is a link to the application, deployed on Heroku: https://vast-castle-11135.herokuapp.com/

Additionally, here is an example of a challenge I did last week: https://fast-ocean-64019.herokuapp.com/
Here is a link to the repo: https://github.com/leahpwatt/react-weather-app
This is a weather app, built in React, that utilizes the openweathermap api. It displays the current temperature of the user's location (you'll have to give permissions when the page loads), as well as the 5-day forecast. It is not what I would deem "complete"; however, it is what I was able to accomplish given the 4-5 hour window of time. I hope this helps provide an additional example of my capabilities.
